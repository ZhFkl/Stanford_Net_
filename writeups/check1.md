Checkpoint 1 Writeup
====================

My name: [your name here]

My SUNet ID: [your sunetid here]

I collaborated with: [list sunetids here]

I would like to thank/reward these classmates for their help: [list sunetids here]

This lab took me about [n] hours to do. I [did/did not] attend the lab session.

I was surprised by or edified to learn that: [describe]

Describe Reassembler structure and design. [Describe data structures and
approach taken. Describe alternative designs considered or tested.
Describe benefits and weaknesses of your design compared with
alternatives -- perhaps in terms of simplicity/complexity, risk of
bugs, asymptotic performance, empirical performance, required
implementation time and difficulty, and other factors. Include any
measurements if applicable.]
reassembler is a continer below the bytestream ,which need to sort the information and put it 
to the buffer_ of the bytestream in sequence, a bytestream is more like a pipe who have reader and writer 
to read from the pipe and writer like the reassembler to write the data into it,then we can transition the
data to the upper api in sequence.
